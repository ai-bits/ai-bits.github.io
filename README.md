# 20170124 Google Tensorflow and MS CNTK Together
After much reading and experimentation I'm starting to collect my AI-bits here.

I got TensorFLow and CNTK running together on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 physical and VMware virtual machines using Anaconda 4.2.

With the standard CNTK installation scripts Anaconda 4.1.1 gets installed, but if you pass the installation location it accepts the version you throw it and works.

Actually I prefer ballroom dancing.
